# Image resize

Process the base images to ensure their width don't exceed what is needed and recompress them to make sure they are as small as possible.

## Configuration

```yaml
input_dir: "generated/static/images/"
max_width: 960
quality: 90
```

## Usage

Nothing to do, images will just have the right size :)
